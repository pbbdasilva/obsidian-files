#### NICs (network interface card)
they are the ones who route information from your pc to the Ethernet (LAN)
they use different types of buses to communicate and each one has a different special task

#### smartNICs
they are a certain of NIC that is specialized in offloading the CPU's host tasks to other parts of the network. They are highly configurable so we are able to use them to choose where to offload data

They integrate via PCIe lanes to data centers
It is said that they are used to offload the server workload to its own CPU

####
DPUs, different from smartNICs, are units used to be a second CPU only.
So, the others are more related to offloading NICs with greater capabilities and some sort of processing power.
