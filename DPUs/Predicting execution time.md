### Paper: Intelligent prediction of execution times

##### Summary
Uses both static + runtime analysis. Some features are gathered at compile and some after profiling. They say [2] tells how to estimate probability of each branch to execute.

For me, the core to understand the paper and make it possible is first be able to predict the profile at static time. So, we go further to [2].
